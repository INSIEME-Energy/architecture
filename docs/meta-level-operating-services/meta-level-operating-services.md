![Application Cooperation Viewpoint of CEEDS Services](./app_coop_vp.png)

As shown in the diagram, within the INSIEME federation strategy, application cooperation is achieved through a federated service ecosystem in which applications and digital customer solutions integrate with common interoperability services rather than establishing bilateral integrations with individual national or sectoral systems. This cooperation is enabled through a harmonised European process interface (S4), regional connector interfaces, and digital customer interfaces, which together allow applications to access cross-border and cross-domain services in a consistent and scalable manner. The S4 common API serves as the principal gateway for European-wide processes and may be deployed either in a decentralised architecture, where interoperability functions are distributed across multiple coordinated nodes, or in a centralised architecture, where a single federated service provides unified access, depending on national and operational requirements. These application interfaces are supported by the CEEDS Operator services providing identity and trust management, semantic and reference data harmonisation, interoperability testing, regulated data services, service monitoring, and marketplace capabilities, thereby ensuring secure, transparent, and reusable integration across the INSIEME ecosystem while supporting innovation, regulatory compliance, and efficient onboarding of new participants and services.

These *CEEDS Meta-Level Operating Systems* are being further specified in *Task 2.2 – Data Space Conceptualisation*, with a finalisation deadline in M18 (October '26). Notably, the structure, terminology and strategy is fully aligned with recent outcomes of the European Commission’s *Data4Energy Expert Group*. The diagram below shows a high-level overview on dependencies, responsibilities and interactions between the different services.

# The reference model for data required for demand response.*

The reference model for data required for demand response is composed of a set of reference procedures for access to data and the necessary information exchanges between roles acted by market participants relating to this specific case. 

The tables in this Annex reflect this set of information that constitutes the reference model. The procedural steps that are set out may be combined or carried out in a different order when applied at the national level. 

Table I contains information regarding the national market structure and environment. It is particularly useful to eligible parties that would like to set up their operation in the respective territory and utilise demand response data access in each Member State. This table must be read in conjunction with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1162 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/XXX. Table I is listing information that needs to be accessible for eligible parties to register, on-board or establish prerequisite infrastructure to take part in the procedures listed in Table III and accordingly communicate and exchange information with relevant market participants occupying the roles and undertaking the responsibilities indicated in Table II.

Some of the procedural steps described in Table III are marked as Conditional, it means that their implementation depends on the rules specified at national level.. 
When the steps as marked as optional, it means that the implementation depends on the objects they relate to [for some baselining methods, baseline validation does not need to go through all the steps].

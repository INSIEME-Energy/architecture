## Function and Objective

Provides a uniform interface based on pivotal information models for all regulated energy data exchanges and market interactions as defined in the CEEDS functional
scope. [here a link to the scope group would be good]

Crucial core component of the CEEDS, providing a common processual interface for all data exchange with a participative and digital European-wide energy market. It provides a common interface for
stakeholders (aggregators, energy community operators, final customers, etc.) to interact with national energy market communication environments, as well as common means to communicate with cloud-edge
structures. Based and in sync with the ERDR, EVC and EPR, it connects and leverages national procedures defined in the CEEDS Scope, and allows EPR-registered actors to utilize EU-level regulated
functions, like balancing and local markets, flexibility information systems, access to metering and consumption data, and much more.

CEEDS Facilitator is responsible to provide and maintain (and optionally operate parts of) such an API with clear integration interfaces for regional connectors. NDSFs shall be responsible to provide
and operate integrations of national and regional environments towards the CAEP. KPIs and Service Levels to be agreed at European level under the course of the ESLO component.

## Business Architecture

<!-- 
The Business Architecture focuses on business requirements. It outlines the structure and operation of an organization, including business goals, functions, processes, and organizational structure. 
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Service Realization Viewpoint

<!-- 
The Service Realization Viewpoint pattern creates elements that show how one or more business services are realized by the underlying processes (and sometimes by application components). 
Thus, it forms the bridge between the business products viewpoint and the business process view. It provides a "view from the outside" on one or more business processes.

## Data Architecture

<!-- 
Data Architecture pertains to the management of data, both physical and logical.
It involves data assets, databases, data models, and the governance of data across the enterprise.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Data Objects

<!-- TODO: Insert list/table of data objects and their descriptions -->

## Application Architecture

<!-- 
The Application Architecture describes individual applications and their interactions.
It addresses software applications and their role in supporting business processes and functions.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Application Cooperation Viewpoint

<!--
The Application Cooperation Viewpoint pattern creates elements a diagram that describe the relationships between applications components  and their locations, the services they provide or utilize and the information that flows between them.
See: https://sparxsystems.com/resources/tutorials/archimate/#Application-Cooperation-Viewpoint

## Technology Architecture

<!--
The Technology Architecture involves the IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, networks, and services.
It ensures that the infrastructure supports the application and data requirements of the business.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Deployment View

<!-- 
The Implementation and Deployment Viewpoint pattern creates elements and a diagram that relate programs and projects to the parts of the architecture that they implement.
This view allows modeling of the scope of programs, projects, project activities in terms of the plateaus that are realized or the individual architecture elements that are affected.
In addition, the way the elements are affected may be indicated by annotating the relationships.

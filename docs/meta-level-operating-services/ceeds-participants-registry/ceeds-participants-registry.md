## Function and Objective
Single European interface linking national registries; enables streamlined cross-border onboarding via eID/eIDAS. 

It provides a single point of reference for European-scale players for all national and European data spaces and platforms relevant for data exchange implied by the CEEDS functional Scope. [here a link to the scope group would be important] 

This may include e.g. onboarding to national data hubs (e.g. Energinet Data Hub), national data exchange environments (e.g. Energy Data Exchange Austria / EDA / ebutilities.at), prequalification of local and balancing service providers, or the registration of Energy Sharing units (e.g. Energy Communities). In line with the recommendations of the Identification and Authentication Group, upcoming CEEDS regulations should foresee a broad adoption of eID, eIDAS and European Digital Identity Wallets to minimize costs at EU and national levels, for both market participants and onboarding platform operators. Registration must be possible across the whole EU market within a reasonable amount of time, without the need to e.g. create legal entities in target MSs, or any other bureaucratic hurdles. 

CEEDS Facilitator should be responsible to maintain a registry at a European level, with a clear interface for National Data Space Registries to link in. National Data Space Facilitators should be responsible to integrate and maintain the link to the CEEDS registry, in a fully digital and machine-processable manner.

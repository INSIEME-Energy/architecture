## Function and Objective
Integrates (in a way of linking and leveraging) existing EU data platforms (e.g. ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, machine-readable information on grid capacity maps as of Grid Action Plan 6a, etc.) within CEEDS. 

Please note that the focus should here be on integration and standardisation, not on replacing existing or other independent platforms.

title: DRAFT - Key Architectural Principles
order: 2
---

## 1. Federated and Subsidiarity-Respecting Architecture
The CEEDS shall be established as a federated European architecture connecting national energy data spaces while respecting Member State competencies and existing national arrangements.

### Policy Orientation
The CEEDS shall build upon and interconnect national infrastructures, ensuring European interoperability and harmonised service delivery while preserving the subsidiarity principle.

### Implementation Considerations
- National Data Space Facilitators (NDSFs) shall remain responsible for national data space integration, operation and compliance with national regulatory frameworks.
- The CEEDS shall avoid centralisation of national data assets or governance competences.
- EU-level coordination shall focus on enabling cross-border interoperability, standardisation and common services.

---

## 2. Minimum Invasiveness to National Environments
The CEEDS architecture shall be designed to minimise disruption to existing national systems, processes, and regulatory arrangements.

### Policy Orientation
CEEDS implementation shall prioritise compatibility with established national infrastructures and market processes, ensuring proportionate and cost-effective integration.

### Implementation Considerations
- Integration shall be based on standardised interfaces rather than replacement of national systems.
- National implementation models shall remain adaptable to local market and regulatory contexts.
- Technical and organisational requirements imposed by CEEDS shall be limited to those necessary to ensure interoperability and secure cross-border data exchange.

---

## 3. Voluntary and Non-Discriminatory Participation
Participation in CEEDS shall be voluntary, open, transparent and non-discriminatory for eligible stakeholders.

### Policy Orientation
The CEEDS shall support progressive adoption by Member States and market actors while ensuring fair and equitable access conditions.

### Implementation Considerations
- Participation shall not create disproportionate entry barriers.
- Late-joining participants shall be able to integrate under fair and transparent conditions.
- Participation frameworks shall promote market innovation and competition.

---

## 4. Clear Allocation of Responsibilities and Liabilities
The CEEDS architecture shall establish a clear and legally robust allocation of roles, responsibilities and liabilities between the CEEDS Operational Entity, National Data Space Facilitators, and participating stakeholders.

### Policy Orientation
Responsibilities shall be defined according to functional roles and operational competences to ensure accountability, transparency and legal certainty.

### Implementation Considerations
- The CEEDS Operational Entity shall be responsible for operating European-level services, interoperability coordination and cross-border service reliability.
- National Data Space Facilitators shall be responsible for national system integration, service-level delivery, and compliance with national legal frameworks.
- Contractual arrangements shall clearly define liability boundaries, service-level obligations and dispute resolution mechanisms.

---

## 5. Commitment to an EU Digital Single Market for Energy, Interoperability and Standardisation by Design
CEEDS shall ensure interoperability through the adoption of harmonised standards, open interfaces, and common data exchange models.

### Policy Orientation
Interoperability shall enable seamless cross-border data exchange and support the functioning of European flexibility markets and sector integration.

### Implementation Considerations
- CEEDS shall rely on European and internationally recognised standards.
- Standardisation shall support multi-sector interoperability, including energy, mobility, and buildings.
- Interfaces and protocols shall be openly documented and governed through transparent change management processes.

---

## 6. Trust, Security and European Data Sovereignty
CEEDS shall embed cybersecurity, privacy protection, and data sovereignty as foundational architectural elements.

### Policy Orientation
The CEEDS shall ensure compliance with applicable Union legislation, including data protection, cybersecurity and data governance frameworks, while safeguarding European strategic autonomy.

### Implementation Considerations
- Federated identity and authentication mechanisms shall be implemented.
- Data access shall be governed through consent management and access control policies.
- Certification, compliance monitoring and cybersecurity governance shall be integrated into CEEDS operations.

---

## 7. Service-Oriented Meta-Operating Framework
CEEDS shall operate as a service-oriented meta-operating framework providing reusable common services to support data exchange and ecosystem coordination.

### Policy Orientation
Common European services shall support national implementations while avoiding duplication and promoting economies of scale.

### Implementation Considerations
Core services may include:
- Identity and trust services
- Participant onboarding and registration
- Discovery and registry services
- Logging, traceability and monitoring
- Certification and testing coordination
- Lifecycle and change management

---

## 8. Composability, Extensibility and Future-Proofing
CEEDS shall be designed to support modular expansion, integration of new use cases and adaptation to evolving technological and regulatory developments.

### Policy Orientation
The CEEDS architecture shall remain adaptable to support the digital transformation of the European energy system and cross-sector integration.

### Implementation Considerations
- Modular functional building blocks shall be adopted.
- Interfaces shall support versioning and backward compatibility.
- Structured change management processes shall ensure controlled evolution of CEEDS services.

# Concluding Statement
These architectural principles aim to support the establishment of CEEDS as a secure, interoperable, and scalable European data-sharing infrastructure. The principles ensure respect for Member State competencies, promote voluntary and fair participation, and provide legal and operational clarity for all involved stakeholders while enabling the long-term digital transformation of the European energy system.

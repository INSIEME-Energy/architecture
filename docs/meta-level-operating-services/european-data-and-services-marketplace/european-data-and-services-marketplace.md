## Function and Objective
Provides a regulated environment for accessing, sharing, and commercializing energy-related data. The EDSM should contain a data catalogue for data indexing and discovery. 

Data service providers may link into this marketplace to offer their services, such as: 
- Forecasting and data analysis for pivotal information model data 
- Crowdsourcing of data based (e.g. feature-based request for data) 
- Refinement of data 
- Storage and accessibility of regulated data (e.g. forecast charging capacity of charging stations collected from Charge Point Operators (CPO), data from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, market data, etc.) 
- Storage and accessibility of statistical data 
- Privacy and pseudonymisation 

EDSM should contain – possibly in close co-operation with SIMPL – a concept for data provision contract negotiation, cost renumeration and commercialization of data, as well as settlement of transactions. EDSM should cover both free-of-charge and chargeable services.

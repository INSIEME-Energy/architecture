## Function and Objective

Integrates (in a way of linking and leveraging) existing EU data platforms (e.g. ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, machine-readable information on grid capacity maps as of Grid Action Plan 6a, etc.)
within CEEDS.

Please note that the focus should here be on integration and standardisation, not on replacing existing or other independent platforms. 

## Business Architecture

<!-- 
The Business Architecture focuses on business requirements. It outlines the structure and operation of an organization, including business goals, functions, processes, and organizational structure. 
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Service Realization Viewpoint

<!-- 
The Service Realization Viewpoint pattern creates elements that show how one or more business services are realized by the underlying processes (and sometimes by application components). 
Thus, it forms the bridge between the business products viewpoint and the business process view. It provides a "view from the outside" on one or more business processes.

## Data Architecture

<!-- 
Data Architecture pertains to the management of data, both physical and logical.
It involves data assets, databases, data models, and the governance of data across the enterprise.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Data Objects

<!-- TODO: Insert list/table of data objects and their descriptions -->

## Application Architecture

<!-- 
The Application Architecture describes individual applications and their interactions.
It addresses software applications and their role in supporting business processes and functions.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Application Cooperation Viewpoint

<!--
The Application Cooperation Viewpoint pattern creates elements a diagram that describe the relationships between applications components  and their locations, the services they provide or utilize and the information that flows between them.
See: https://sparxsystems.com/resources/tutorials/archimate/#Application-Cooperation-Viewpoint

## Technology Architecture

<!--
The Technology Architecture involves the IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, networks, and services.
It ensures that the infrastructure supports the application and data requirements of the business.
See: https://www.fconsulting.tech/togaf-10-understanding-the-7-core-concepts/
-->

### Deployment View

<!-- 
The Implementation and Deployment Viewpoint pattern creates elements and a diagram that relate programs and projects to the parts of the architecture that they implement.
This view allows modeling of the scope of programs, projects, project activities in terms of the plateaus that are realized or the individual architecture elements that are affected.
In addition, the way the elements are affected may be indicated by annotating the relationships.

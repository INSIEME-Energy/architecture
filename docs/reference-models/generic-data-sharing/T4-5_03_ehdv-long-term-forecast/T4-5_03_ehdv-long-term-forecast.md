# Reference model for *Long-term Power Forecast -- Connecting System Operator and electric Heavy-Duty Vehicles*

Task 4.5 -- Electromobility: Long-term Power Forecast -- Connecting System Operator and electric Heavy-Duty Vehicles

## Context

(1)     The present document focuses on information exchange between Connecting System Operator (CSO) and electric Heavy-Duty Vehicle (eHDV) for the purpose of improving long-term grid hosting capacity forecasts and improving access for the eHDV sector to CSO's grid hosting capacity forecasts.

(2)     In the context of the present document, a long-term forecast considers a time horizon of 0-10 years and differs from a short-term forecast that covers the period from the current operational hour up to several weeks ahead.

(3)     The ambition in this reference model is to make forecasts as generic as possible, suitable for information exchange between CSO and other stakeholders.

(4)     Presently, the eHDV sector does not have access to information on future grid hosting capacity.

(5)     A new requirement for electricity CSOs, at both transmission and distribution levels, is to publish and update information on the capacity available for new connections in their areas of operation, both for production and consumption.

(6)     The European Commission has acknowledged a gap between grid capacity and connection demand as an issue that must be addressed and launched several initiatives on network development plans, grid hosting capacity information and flexibility need assessment. (Regulation 2024/1747 and Directive 2024/1711)

(7)     Grid Action Plan Action number 6 urges ENTSO-E and the EU DSO Entity to *'(...) establish a pan-EU overview that should give visibility to project developers when conceptualising their projects, such as new renewable or EV recharging infrastructure projects and help developers estimate the risk of connection request approval delays and, thus, have a clearer forecast about when projects can start receiving revenues'.*

(8)     Presently, CSOs do not have any access to representative long-term power forecast requirements from future eHDV fleets.

(9)     Information on future power needs of eHDV fleets is required by CSOs in order to plan for the expansion of the grid. The power demand from eHDVs has a significant impact on CSOs and should be included in CSO Power Forecast and in the future mandatory 10-year Network Development Plans (Draft TYNDP from ENTSO-E to ACER May 2025).

(10)     The eHDV regulation framework includes the CO2 regulation (EU 2019/1242) to reduce tailpipe CO2 with 45% to 2030 vs. 2019. Since the regulation addresses limiting tailpipe emissions, zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are the only viable alternative for complying with the regulation. Approximately one third of new vehicle registrations 2030 must be zero-emission. The majority (~90%) will be Battery Electric Vehicles ["The technological and market readiness of heavy-duty road transport vehicles" DG Move May 27, 2025].

(11)     It is essential for the fulfilment of the CO2 regulation that SOs can prepare the grid in time to enable connection of ~40.000 fast chargers and ~400.000 slow chargers in Europe to support a fleet of 400.000 ZEVs. As of Q2 2025, there is an estimated ~1000-1100 eHDV accessible fast chargers (>350kW) in Europe [Source: EY and Milence].

(12)     Regulation (EU) 2023/18042 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (AFIR) is under implementation in member states to support the roll-out of zero-emission vehicles. The same regulation imposes demands on charging hubs of 7.2 MW every 60 km along the TEN-T core network and 3.0 MW along the TEN-T comprehensive network.

(13)     AFIR sets minimum requirements. However, considerably more fast charging and private or private shared charging in depots is required to support the fleet size derived from the CO2 regulation.

(14)     Grid hosting capacity maps are a useful tool to evaluate where and when grid capacity will be available for connecting these charging hubs to the grid. Each member state is responsible for providing AFIR compliance plans to the commission.

(15)     Electricity grid project developers require long-term grid hosting capacity information from CSOs in order to make future energy infrastructure investments.

(16)     CSOs need information on customers' and other relevant stakeholders' future needs for grid hosting capacity for network development plans, assessing future flexibility needs and reliable grid hosting capacity long-term forecasts.

(17)     Forecasts for future charging capacity needs of eHDVs can be based on (i) historic driving patterns of HDVs and (II) energy consumption and charging data from existing eHDVs. Currently, there is a limited number of eHDVs circulating but, with new data continuously collected, more accurate forecasts are likely. For CSOs, the requirement are the future charging capacity needs for the various grid locations (in MW).

(18)     To respect privacy and ensure competitiveness, forecasts from eHDVs charging capacity needs are currently made for geographical areas that do not necessarily align with the ones defined by grid structure. Finding ways to bridge this misalignment is essential.

(19)     Forecasts for eHDVs' future charging capacity needs are to be restricted to parties with access rights.

(20)     Access to grid hosting capacity is unrestricted.

(21)     The energy sector is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by decarbonization, decentralization, digitalisation and electrification. Long-term forecasts are essential to anticipate future energy demand, generation capacity and infrastructure needs. Such forecasts enable proactive investment and policy planning, efficient grid use and the avoidance of stranded assets.

(22)     Stakeholders, including transmission and distribution system operators, regulators, and market participants---require a harmonized approach to forecasting for aligning national and regional strategies. This document addresses a common framework for the development, validation and use of long-term power forecasts that encourages the consistent and transparent application of long-term forecasting practices in support of a resilient and sustainable energy system.

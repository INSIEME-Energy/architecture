## Function and Objective
Provides a uniform interface based on pivotal information models for all regulated energy data exchanges and market interactions as defined in the CEEDS functional scope. [here a link to the scope group would be good] 

Crucial core component of the CEEDS, providing a common processual interface for all data exchange with a participative and digital European-wide energy market. It provides a common interface for stakeholders (aggregators, energy community operators, final customers, etc.) to interact with national energy market communication environments, as well as common means to communicate with cloud-edge structures. Based and in sync with the ERDR, EVC and EPR, it connects and leverages national procedures defined in the CEEDS Scope, and allows EPR-registered actors to utilize EU-level regulated functions, like balancing and local markets, flexibility information systems, access to metering and consumption data, and much more. 

CEEDS Facilitator is responsible to provide and maintain (and optionally operate parts of) such an API with clear integration interfaces for regional connectors. NDSFs shall be responsible to provide and operate integrations of national and regional environments towards the CAEP. KPIs and Service Levels to be agreed at European level under the course of the ESLO component.
